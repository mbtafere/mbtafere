<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Michael Kenn Tafere</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Computer Science student from the University of the Philippines Los Baños</h3>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science subjects in UPLB and right now I am focused on **Web Programming, Operating Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages and Computer Architecture**

- 👨‍💻 My projects include: A simple Android social app created with Flutter, where users can add and manage friends. A survival game designed for two players, developed using Java.

- 📄 Know about me: I’m from Bay, Laguna, where I was born and raised. As a child, and for a good part of my junior high years, I wasn’t very interested in computers or digital devices maybe due to lack of exposure to those things. Instead, I spent most of my time outside, playing with my neighbors and friends. I chose Computer Science program at the very last minute as I am not really sure what I want to take and pursue that's why I entered college with no prior knowledge about computer programming.

- 🎮 Hobbies: I love watching short-form videos, which is a great way for me to relax and stay entertained. I also like playing games, mostly on mobile.
